# Lesson 7.6 Exit Ticket 
### Entity Relationship Modeling

## Directions
* Read the following article on [Entity Relationship Diagrams - Crow's Foot Notation](http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~bernatja/crowsfoot.html).

* Follow the subsequent steps to create a ERD using Crow's Foot Notation. We will be building a hypothetical model of [Yelp](https://yelp.com).
   1. Yelp is a system. As we've learned, systems are comprised of _entities_. List as many entities of Yelp as you can think of.
   2. Choose any **four** connected entities. First, in shorthand notes, describe the relationship between these interconnected entities.
   3. Use [draw.io](https://draw.io) to construct an ERD using Crow's Foot Notation for the four entities you selected.
   4. In `erd.md`, describe your ERD in clear, concise sentences. Be sure to explain the reasoning behind each set of relationships in your diagram. Strong responses will use the phrases _has one_, _belongs to_, _has many_, and _belongs to many_. Be sure to export your diagram as a PNG file and include the photo in your markdown file.
